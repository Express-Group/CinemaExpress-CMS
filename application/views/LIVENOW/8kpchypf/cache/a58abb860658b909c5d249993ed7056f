Temperatures on the surface were also a bit higher than we would normally expect from a laptop with this hardware. The GPU is based on the Sun GCN architecture on the 28nm node and it uses 320 or 384 shaders, depending on the version. We recorded Fall Time + Rise Time = 13 ms. Pulse-width modulation (PWM) is an easy way to control monitor brightness. ?Day 2-I woke up and in excitement, I opened the laptop. Intel claims that the new UHD 620 chips improve the overall power consumption compared to the previous one. This wasn't good! Ssd space becomes as low as 23G, with 63G free initially.
