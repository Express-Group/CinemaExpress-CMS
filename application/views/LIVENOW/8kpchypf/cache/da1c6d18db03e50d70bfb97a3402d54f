Very fast delivery, great quality and better than expected. Because of regulations barring batteries from air mail, this product is generally constrained to ground transport, which tends to take a bit longer, and also limits where we can send it. Love the battery and the comfortable head strap. Thanks Nivrana for selling a great product! I like it, came great packaged in a etui. So in a nutshell, yes, the second iteration of Rebuff Realitys battery extender for Facebooks standalone headset works well. I'd also hate to see the ES+B break (which is very common) since then you're out of your strap AND battery. Easy to use and arrived on time, would highly recommend if you intend on using your Quest 2 for extended periods of time. The package that arrived was way more comprehensive than I expected it to be and the quality is excellent with a premium feel to it. Just got the elite strap with battery and Max so far is around 5 hours til it dies. Perfect fit for my Quest 2. This is the second one Ive bought and they are a huge help when trying to watch long movies or playing games where you dont want to stop or in situations where you want to be able to chill with friends your friends all night in the Karaoke room. This makes the power bank easy to attach and does not get in the way while using the headset. Very happy using on my oculus quest2. I've got the regular Elite Strap with the Rebuff Reality VR Power 1, my family has the Elite Strap with Battery, and my friend has the OG strap with a VR Power 2, so I've seen it all! The battery pack allows for much longer play time. Read our story. That said, the $129 combo for VR Power 2 and Elite Strap is neck-and-neck with Facebooks own Elite Battery Strap and Carry Case.
