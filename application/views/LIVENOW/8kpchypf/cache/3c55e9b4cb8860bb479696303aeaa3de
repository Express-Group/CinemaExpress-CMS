I have a Honeywell Lynx touch L7000 and a yale real living touch with zwave modules in both devices, the 6 or 8 digits of my users enroled in the lock device works a time, but dont works later, I was enroled this same users in the lynx l7000 but only with 4 digits and work very good, I only can have code users with 4 digits? I preferred the 2gig and alarm.com in my previous house vs the Tuxedo Touch. &8 5JZu -*HF\`ZF742e(Xq0q0L/lAi+O6&Ox60xj`#0,-92HD Qt]$A  p{ So basically Amazon just lists the wrong Z-Wave add-on (or sends the wrong one) when buying the Bluetooth lock that's listed as Z-Wave? I am curious though, what system are you using your Tuxedo Touch with? 0 You would need to press and hold that button until the lock beeps twice after putting the Tuxedo into inclusion mode. I don't know who user #1 is (maybe installer?) Once the Nest x Yale Lock is paired with the Nest. I took out the Zwave module. After you have the master pin setup you will want to setup other PINs at the Honeywell Lynx Touch alarm system. 286 0 obj<>stream I'm not sure what the model number is, i just bought it off of amazon a few days ago. But I thought I had to get the door lock in Enrollment mode before I connected to the Honeywell (?). However you can keep the Veralite enrolled as the primary controller and continue to use both controllers. Are you trying to enroll the lock to a Honeywell security system utilizing a Z-Wave controller? I would also like the ability to remotely add/delete deadbolt codes. Thanks! My dilemma, was I 1st had all the codes entered manually into both devices (even using the same user numbers on each device for simplicity. It was bizzare though that the user 1 code on the lock would disarm the system even though the same pin would not disarm the panel when used on the panel. Initially, I set matching PINs on both the lock and the Lynx and found my codes working then not working then working. You can repeat these steps for up to 25 users since that is the maximum supported on most Yale Z-Wave locks. Further, what about the Lyric? At about this point I figured out that the zwave was pushing down the codes so quickly decided to reset lock to factory settings and start over without adding any codes (other than a required master) to the lock and it worked fine. I didn't believe that code was in my panel so I tested it by arming the panel and using this code to attempt a panel-based disarm and is did not disarm on the panel, but it disarmed for some reason as user #1 on the lock. The module choices don't show up online when you purchase, so i'm not sure how anyone would know what to order. It's not possible to have two installer codes so I imagine one really isn't working or one is actually a Master Code or sub User code instead of installer code. We recommend the Yale YRD210 or YRD220. The only thing we can use with the 5800 Converter is the doors, windows and motions. If you aren't under contract now, it would be easy to switch to us if you were interested. Please view the images and image captions below for full instructions. User #'s on the panel may not match up to Pin #'s on the lock. The problem is when I press 4 1 1 2 8 0 0 (Keypad accepts only 6 digits, It wakes up as you expect, but it immediately unlocks/disarms!!! Not sure if it's wise to try and switch. For example, I setup the master PIN to match user #3 on the panel. I might try that again when I have time. The alarm panels do not support Z-Wave technology without that controller. It sounds like some of these locks are sold without the Z-Wave module and therefore don't integrate with a Z-Wave controller. BRL I have the same problem with my Assure lock number 7 won't appear. Give it a about 30 seconds to initiate the pairing mode. I have found that the master code from an L5200 will not work on the yale lock in order to disarm it, only sub users have the ability to do it. (without ever having entered a complete code). By doing this, it will automatically send this PIN to the lock and be configured with locking control. What I am doing not right? * and #, I can see CON ADDR=16 After the lock is properly installed the first step is to "include" the lock into the Lynx Touch alarm panel. I did this because of the bug with the User #2 (master) not working to disarm the system when opening the door lock. Unfortunately this is not possible on the L5200. I did this a few times.. No, you actually have to put the Tuxedo in inclusion mode and then hit the function button on the lock to enroll it to the Tuxedo. User 1 is in the installer and User 2 is the master code. From the touchscreen display home screen on your Lynx Touch, press Security > More > Tools > Enter your Master Code (Default is 1234) > Users. In order for a PIN on the door lock to be capable of disarming the system, you must enable the "Zwave lock control" and set the "Zwave locking door" selection to "disarm." An ASSA ABLOY Group brandSchool Street, Willenhall, West Midlands, WV13 3PW. I then simply went to my 5100 panel and Tool>users>edit with zwave lock control to Yes and Z-wave Unlocking door to "disarm". They were really easy to work with via email. Maybe i'm still doing it wrong.  You will be guided to set up the Master Passcode by following the. Now you can toggle the locking door selection to Arm Away, Arm Stay or Arm without auto-stay.

I purchased the 5200L for our home monitoring and have been adding z-wave lights and switches. Since you will be arming from outside your home we recommend choosing "Arm without Auto-Stay." 	HG RD I believe you can still add additional pins to the lock if needed that aren't going to disarm, but for any PINs you want to disarm, just push them over from the panel. When I press Yes, you can use the 5800C2W module to convert wired zones into wireless zones that could then be programmed into the Lyric system.  Have you experienced otherwise? You can also configure the lock so that each time it is locked it will arm your Lynx Touch system. Enter your current master code and then press the hash button. On my 5100, I think the master is user #2. I'm pretty sure that the master code was disarming the panel too. I have not added other arbitrary codes to the lock user #1, but it seems like lock programmed user 1 might be able to disarm the panel regardless. Yale are committed to continuously improving our services and support to our Customers. The only Zwave choice is wrong for Bluetooth. Using Keypad 6160, (I also have 6150) I have changed address.

If your master code hasn't been set, it will be automatically programmed to 123456. I have replaced Old Ademco 15P with new Ademco 15p due to false alarm. Anything that's wired to the system will not work with the Lyric system. Then reset your Z-wave controller and re-include it. Apparently, there is a special module for the Assure locks. We offer some affordable no contract options that include the TC2 automation services for remote access to those locks.  When the lock is ready to be paired go into the "Automation" menu from the home screen. My 1st lock would freeze within about 10 seconds of connecting to panel, and my 2nd lock has this glitch.

Instinctively, you press your hand on the pad to wake it again. It sounds like you should exclude the lock. Changing to a different lock is not an option as I do not wish to purchase new keysets due to the costs. Did you notice we offer no-contract monitoring plans online at https://www.alarmgrid.com/monitoring? Existing wired keypads, sirens and life safety sensors would not work with the Lyric or the 5800C2W, but the Lyric supports a wireless keypad (https://www.alarmgrid.com/products/honeywell-lkp500 ) and a wireless siren (https://www.alarmgrid.com/products/honeywell-sixsiren) and the Honeywell wireless smoke/heat detectors (https://www.alarmgrid.com/browse/smoke-and-heat-detectors/brands/honeywell ) work with the Lyric as well. How do I program codes to Yale Real Living ZWAVE lock. Make sure you have it installed in the door when doing so. : That added to my confusion in the article. hbbd```b``y"A$^"E[awD We're experts on Honeywell and 2Gig systems and offer the TC2 and Alarm.com services.

The Lyric is the latest and greatest all-in-one wireless system from Honeywell and if you wanted to tie in wired zones, you'd need to use the 5800C2W (https://www.alarmgrid.com/documents/honeywell-5800c2w-installation-manual ). In programming, I wnet back and deleted some of the users on the lock fully expecting them to not be active, but since they were in the Z-wave they continued to work on the lock. Is it possible to add/delete codes using the Honeywell VAM and Z-Wave lock sets? I'm told I can on the Lynx. I used to be able to do this on  my 2gig with alam.com interface. If you want this feature enabled you will need to go back into the Automation menu: Down Key > Advanced Tools > Enter Installer or Master Code (4112 and 1234 by default) > Locking Door.
