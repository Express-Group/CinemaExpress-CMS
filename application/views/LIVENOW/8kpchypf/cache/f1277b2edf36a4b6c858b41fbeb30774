Marking gauges excel at cutting a line parallel to the edge of a board, which is vital for laying out accurate tenons, mortises, and the baseline for dovetails. On woods with tricky grain, like tiger maple, or when youve got a small bit of tearout on an otherwise clean board, theres no tool like a card scraper. Sorry, but it has no place on a basic woodworking tools list. I think it depends on the type of woodworker you would like to become. UNLIMITED membership - Get access to it all. You dont need a full fledged metal detector. Oh, and dont forget a 1/4 tongue and groove bit. I then modified the saw to improve its performance for cabinet quality work by putting a zero clearance baseplate (just a piece of 1/4 plywood screwed to the base) this allows the saw to cut plywood panels without tearing up the edges. 8. Therefore, either get a good set of stones or proper grades of sand paper and a flat surface such as a piece of float glass or granite tile. amzn_assoc_region = "US"; My guide has a plate on which the saw is mounted. Dovetails are the hallmark of craftsmanship, and the effort to cut them by hand is well worth it. A Workmate, a puttering bench and clamps. Unlike a handplane, a scraper has no risk of tearout. Would a six inch jointer be better..not by much. It may seem like a lot on the surface, but a long rectangle is a bear to work in. The tool is available with a flat or curved sole, but I recommend the flat sole, as it works well even on concave surfaces. You will need to sharpen them (again not expensive  piece of plate glass and some sandpaper). I was telling my brother of the different ways I sharpen and he seemed interested in the slab/sandpaper method. A good finish starts with good surface preparation, and hand tools are the fastest way to remove machine marks and tearout. And a lot of different approaches  money, space, time, resources, etc. The 12-in. Jointer/Planer is top on my list as well, but in my shop, a $250 vintage 14 bandsaw is superior to a circular saw for ripping (and cuts curves as well). Handsaws can be used for crosscutting and anything else the bandsaw cannot handle. Regardless of how you cut joinery, you should have a shoulder plane, because nothing is better for fine-tuning joints for a perfect fit. Better add a sliding t- bevel, a protractor, and a compass. Cant see anyone getting very far without them. Upon arrival the first power tool that I bought was a cordless drill/driver and the second was a circular saw. After you have the basic set, add a wide chisel (11/2 in. They will replace the band saw if required, though they are slow. Also, take advantage of free shipping offers. Double up the benchtop with two layers of 3/4 and some wood glue. 3. I fared well for many years using only sanders to smooth surfaces, though today I couldnt imagine being without a plane. The other crucial thing I am concerned with is having tools that will allow me to work efficiently with rough cut or reclaimed lumber, because I need to save money on materials. And its well worth the effort because using them will help you to make better furniture, period. When I do need to take my hand tools somewhere, the larger tools end up in a simple tongue and grooved latch box my grandfather owned. Later I purchased another Shopsmith Mark V Model 510 for the increase in table size and flexibility. Once the initial cut is made in the plywood, the plywood is simply lined up with your cut marks and clamped down. I have a Nicholson backsaw I bought at a local store before I knew of the woodworking suppliers. Even when I handplane a surface, Ill often follow up with a card scraper to remove any imperfections. Im really eclectic  classic furniture to whirligigs. 8. Dan,  my work space that is available for power tools is quite small, about 6 x 20. It works very well on ripping lumber, logs, etc. Note that I am by no means reinventing the wheel with this list. One of those tools is a spokeshave. At last we come to that most iconic hand tool, the bench plane. But dont feel bad about buying the dozuki first. A powered router is strictly forbiddenI would rather use my hand skills and take credit (or apologize) for each joint. Most of it makes sense, but I question the first item. What am I forgetting?

These days Dan is a former online editor for Popular Woodworking, and is learning new skills every day. 11 (or so) Basic Woodworking Tools  A List for New Furniture Makers, https://www.popularwoodworking.com/wp-content/uploads/popwood_logos-01.png, https://www.popularwoodworking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/photo-1426927308491-6380b6a9936f.jpeg,  2020 Active Interest Media. They are way too large of an investment and take up a lot of space (not to mention you can buy your stock at the desired dimensions). A jack plane is an absolute must for any joinery work. Make a tool box that teaches you fundamental carcase construction techniques. I recommend one like the Veritas standard wheel gauge for your first. Second, the nut used to lock it down shouldnt get in the way of using the gauge (a frequent problem with the wing nut used on some gauges). First he lived 3 hours by car and my wife needed our only car. Anyway, this is my two cents worth, and a little different view point from others expressed here. You only have to deal with small chunks of wood getting into the pockets, which can be dealt with if you or your other half are crafty enough to sew some flaps. Well see how it goes.

Card scrapers are cheaper than random orbit sanders and they dont make tons of dust or ruin your hearing.

Paying full price for many board feet of smooth, dimensioned stock is a fairly quick way to go broke  or at least lose your love of woodworking. A circular saw with a guide is handy.
