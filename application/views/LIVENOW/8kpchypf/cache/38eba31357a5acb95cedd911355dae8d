I sometimes get my head chewed off here for writing something someone thought as offensive. If you wanted a brown horse, and you could only get white locally, what would you do? Thanks Marjorie! You can check out the AVSA web site for clubs in your area, and you can also check the Coming Events to see when shows and sales will be occurring. I have my plants in a southeast window where they receive morning sunlight here in Florida. Thanks. I have never seen a variegated violet at a local store or nursery. Fill the container with water. And if you're happy with the selection then that's great, but by doing so you have greatly limited the kind of violets you will be able to purchase. Go figure. This plant is aptly named as it is the violet that is most common throughout Florida and is often seen in cultivated lawns. Finding those violets at a local store is pretty much impossible. Called Central Florida Ferns. But I do love the AV and I am here to learn from other nice people, not offend them!When I feel a sense of offense, I simply ignore the response. Flowersmay be blue, violet or lilac.
