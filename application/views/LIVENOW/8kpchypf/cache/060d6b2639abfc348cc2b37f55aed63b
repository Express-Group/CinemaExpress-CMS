You can probably leave the two pouches at home this time, since on a backpacking trip you really need to slim things down. This is a pretty nifty system that we havent seen anywhere else, but we should note that the placement of these buttons is not finalPeak Design is still working on it, and theyve said that the placement on launch might be a bit different. For sure. Bean backpack). It's not meant to be used for long stretches of time as a duffel, but rather as a method to easily move it from one stationary position to another. Basically, this main compartment is a giant bucket that works well with Peak Designs dedicated travel accessories and packing cubes. One of our contacts has been using the Peak Design Everyday Messenger and theyve gone through two bags because the main zipper has broken on each of them. Save time. Finally, the side pockets you are given aren't very expansive, meaning if you have anything larger than a very small travel tripod, not all the legs fit in the side pockets. The rain cover, which slides out of the bottom of the bag via it's own little pocket, is held closed by a magnet. Learn more,  Get up to 10% off Peak Design  Join Pack Hacker Pro. Backpacking: This is a terrible idea with this backpack for a couple reasons. I never do it. Side handles provide a funky, imbalanced carry. This is one area of the pack where Peak Design chose to use the Zoom zippers we mentioned in the beginning. This isn't helped by the expanding pocket making the bag even deeper and pushing weight even farther away from your body. Passar ven andra ryggsckar med liknande mtt (33 x 56 x 23-29cm) Travel Backpack kan ndras i storlek mellan 35till 45 liter drav 23-29cm). Magnets rock. There are rear straps for mounting a tripod, but no way to prevent those items from slipping downwards since there's no pocket to secure the legs of a tripod, Uncomfortable: the straps are not adjustable at the shoulders meaning if you aren't just the right build, the straps are going to pinch, Waist straps are unhelpful and floppy, making them unable to properly redistribute weight, Back-heavy: when you wear the pack, it doesn't want to push any weight to the sides, or make use of vertical space. It's too tall, and the way the bag is designed doesn't let me distribute its height more evenly below the base of the bag. Travel (car): My aforementioned camping trip with the backpack is a prime example of this bag's shortcomings even when having more space via the back of a car is an option. Especially not if there is a cold climate where you are going. Before I get into the things that don't quite sit right with me, I'll first talk about the things this bag does do right. Everyday Office Bag: Peak Design shows that the Travel Backpack can slim down and become more of an everyday wearable bag, but it's just not a likely scenario, at least not for me. 22 in                           x  13 in                           x  9 in                          (55.9                           x 33                           x 22.9 cm), Depth increases to 11" (28 cm) when expanded, Aluminum, Hypalon, Polyurethane, DWR Coating, YKK Zippers, Nylon, Zoom Zippers. Maybe, but it's getting tight. The things that make Peak Design bags great are muted here, and that's really disappointing. Our one nitpick is the aluminum hardware, which takes a bit getting used to. The aforementioned waist straps that fold up into the back of the pack? That being said, Peak Design tends to release their bags in a lot of different colors, so were curious to see if they try anything later in 2018 or early 2019. We actually utilize Zoom Zippers for all of our bags and packs! We liked seeing that theyve improved that a bit. That's really neat. The camera cube is well designed, yet not innovative. With a similar design, it holds everything I need for a week on the road (or more). Instead of the multiple-ribbed interior that works well for small things in the tech pouch, the wash pouch instead had a divider that crosses two main sections and a center divider that has a small pocket of its own. But that's not even all: the shoulder straps are not adjustable at the shoulder level and are, for me and a few others I've spoken to, badly positioned and end up pinching and tilting on their own axis. They included this along with a set of other tweaks they fix in the final bag. This should be used as a guideline rather than a rule. If there was a competition for how fast can you hide your backpack straps, you would want this bag. Theres the right amount of padding, its the right size, and its easily stowable when you dont want to use it. There is also a detachable sternum strap, which can be stored permanently in the vertical position along the strap, or temporarily as a little loop that hangs off. Plus, its never going to breakbecause, you know, metal and stuff.

The Medium Cube plus the two pouches takes up the entire middle bag, so your only option will be to cram into the front of the bag where all your clothes can't wait to get wrinkled as they mash against each other in transit. Not going to happen. Yup, clip together with magnets. The farther back you push the weight, the more you as the wearer have to lean forward to compensate. To illustrate, let me cover the different needs I have on different days: Travel (airplane): I hate checking luggage, and I especially hate it if that luggage has photo equipment in it. If you want see one of our favorite strap hiding systems, go check out the Evergoods MPL30. Much like their other gear, our first impression is that this bag has a lot of smart, innovative thinking, and it most definitely lives up to the hype. This is a nice pocket for all of your airport essentials, and theyve done a nice job making this pocket really blend into the rest of the bag. At the time of this review, the Peak Design Travel Backpack comes in two different colorsblack on black, and sageand we opted for the black on black (obviously). You'll end up carrying a mostly empty, giant backpack with you when you really just need something smaller for a sweatshirt and a laptop when you're jumping on the train to get to work. So while you could fit a few things in this backpack, it doesn't eliminate the need for a second bag if your trip is going to take more than two days. Small pockets in the tech and wash pouches? It's not comfortable. Egenskaper: Upp till 16" laptop (40,6 x 30 x 2,5 cm) Volym: 30L min, 35L normal, 45L max Innermtt standard (HxBxD): 51 x 28,5 x 16,5 cm Innermtt utkad (HxBxD): 51 x 28,5 x 19cm Innermtt komprimerad (HxBxD): 51 x 28,5 x 14cm Vikt: 2,05 kg. If I want to bring the Tech Pouch in addition to the Medium Cube, I now have a very small amount of square footage to try and fit clothing. One minor detail is that its a little bit easier to detach than wed likeone side grips a little bit harder than the other and it comes off pretty easily, which always makes us a little nervous. The straps themselves have no rigidity to them, so they can't actually hold or distribute any kind of weight; they just collapse. It's flimsy and has a little pouch with a small velcro pull tab on it. It is a beefy #10 zipper, but its not YKKand that gives us some cause for concern. However, that means you can fold up a flap that is sewn to the insides to create a more snug package for whatever you're carrying. That's about all there is to report there. But in my experience, it's really not particularly good at being any of those things for a working, traveling photographer with the exception of one specific case. To be honest, were bit confused with the choice of Zoom zippers, but well cover that later in the review. We expect theyll work pretty well. I even have three different sling packs for business meetings (one that looks more like a briefcase, one that is more like a fashion statement, and one that can actually hold a camera). Another contact had the zipper break on her Everyday Backpack. It breaks the laws of physics. That main compartment is also accessible from the zippers on the sideso if you have things strategically positioned in here, you can swing the bag around your body, unzip it from the side, and grab what you need. If a thief is quickly rifling through everything, theyll likely just pass by your bag if theyre unable to access it quickly. I feel like I'm still, to this day, discovering new pockets in this backpack. Maybe it's just for miscellaneous stuff you didn't have a place for anywhere else. Were really curious as to why Peak Design didnt include YKK zippers across the entirety of this pack. Just because a bag is listed as carry-on compliant here doesn't mean that the airline will interpret it that way. One last feature to note is that all the zippers on this bag are lockable with O-rings and they also come with some additional security features: None of these are completely foolproof, but theyre a deterrent. The top area has an interesting, rubbery-feeling mesh, which gets the job done and allows you to see whatever items you have in there. Unfortunately, it's not really possible with this bag. These are no exception, and they're easy to remove and replace and they hold even heavier pieces of gear in position. The larger dividers, the ones that move the full length of the cube, look like new designs to me, but are just Velcro-friendly rigid cloth bars that hold the other dividers. No detaching straps, no zippers, no nonsense. You can put your contact information in there, so someone can get in touch with you if you were to ever lose this pack (yikesdont want to think about that). Even bringing enough clothes for a couple days in a tent was a challenge, with the same issues regarding having to decide between the two pouches and having clothing rearing its head. We should note that this plastic keeper can be a little bit hard to get back on if it falls off Youll probably have to take the bag off and fiddle with it a little bit. To get those, you need to jump up to $400. Another big part of our decision to use Zoom is that weve been able to develop a close direct relationship with them, something were not able to do with a supplier of YKKs size. I mention in the very first section of this review that there are Peak Design "touches" on bag that can be appreciated, and that's true. Also held closed by magnets.  Peak Design (@peakdesignltd) August 21, 2018. In contrast, the laptop partition has some more Velcro and is super easy to close without even looking at it. This is, without a doubt, the best strap hideaway system we have found to date. It carries a good amount of equipment, easily fits in a laptop, chargers and cables, and as long as the lighting equipment is on set and doesn't need to fit in the bag, means that there might even be room for a light jacket in there too. There is something really satisfying about hearing something snap and hold in place via a magnet, and I love their use in this bag. In their marketing, Peak Design makes a point to talk about how this bag can be anything you need it to be by transforming and adjusting it via modular pieces to go from office bag, to day pack, to full travel bag. They are, however, perfect for grabbing the bag out of overhead bins. Join the Co-op and earn a lifetime of benefits. Nothing to write home about. Vi anvnder cookies fr att gra ditt besk s enkelt och trivsamt som mjligt. YKK zippers are on just about every heavy-hitting travel pack thats in the premium category, so its pretty odd that theyve decided to venture away from them. If youve been following us or youre into backpacks, photography, or travelyouve probably heard of Peak Design. The straps themselves offer some high-density foam, which is definitely very comfortablemore comfortable, in fact, than the Everyday Backpack. Really digging all these cool features, still getting used to some things like the hip belt clip. Zoom has been super responsive to our requests for tweaks and customizations. When you see it on someone's back, it's just kind of a big, black blob. Disclaimer: We take the measurements of the bag provided by the manufacturer and compare them to the allowance listed on airline websites. The magnetic pocket is great for holding a rain flyif you get caught in a torrential downpour, its nice to have that as an option for some additional weatherproofing. You might assume this pocket is unusable while youve got a water bottle in the main sleeve, but theres a good amount of gussetting that provides quite a bit of expandability. So while I can only speak to the sample I have, I trust that my qualms with this feature have been mediated in the finished product.). If you need more space (like I often do, since I'm a videographer and therefore my kit is substantially larger), you can gain six or so more slots by expanding to the Large Photo Cube but then you sacrifice the ability to carry your Tech Pouch, Wash Pouch and most certainly any clothing pouches. This is a system, not just a backpack. Backpacks that excel at distributing their weight try and make use of all possible directions. Update: we spoke with Peak Design about their Zoom Zipper decision and heres what they had to say: Regarding our use of Zoom zips on the main access points, weve chosen Zoom because of a number of factors: strength, feel, testing performance, performance over time, and value.  I am a stickler when it comes to waist straps. Well, this pouch can at times feel just like that. But man, they really did kill it with those two pouches though. Peak Design has historically placed the carrying pockets and straps for tripods on the sides of their bags, and that has not changed here. They have a massive following and a lot of people love what they do, including myself. That purchase makes no sense because the backpack is really kind of useless without any internal compartments. At the time of this review, we have been testing this bag for three weeks in Detroit, Minneapolis and Northern Minnesota, as well as two flights. Lastly, there are two compression features on this pack. And thats about it! This may be a pro or con, depending on your use case and style taste. Everything on this harness system is hideablefast. Material: Utsida i vattentligt 400D nylonkanvas med DRW impregnering. Little things like this are what they are known for, and yeah, it's a good design. Unlike with the Everyday Messenger or Backpack, the Travel Backpack is more of an amalgamation of other bag designs from across the industry into a rather characterless, featureless, bland experience. The entire industry, not just bags. Maybe you want that, but I would rather see something else from these guys who pride themselves on different takes in a sea of look-alikes. The Travel Backpack has what I would qualify as bad waist straps. Aside from the design of the interior bag being a bit confusing for the number of ways Peak Design says you can use the bag, there are some straight up design decisions that aren't best for any type of backpack, especially those that are larger and heavier like the Travel Backpack is. The way I did get it to fit, by only putting two legs in the pocket, didn't feel super secure to me. If you go into this expecting a backpack that has a dedicated role, you'll be disappointed. More than two days? Aside from those aforementioned three or four places they use magnets, which is kind of their awesome schtick, and the thoughtful placement of the many pockets, there are a real lack of distinguishing features about this bag that makes it a Peak Design bag. (Sidenote: Our bag didnt come with lash straps! No visible marks on the exterior after three weeks and no problems with the zippers yet. I don't see the medium cube being great for long-term, full time photo use because even if it does have enough size for you, half the bag is still empty and it feels like a very large bag to only use half of it. Weve also noticed that it does a great job of keeping its form even while empty, due to the high density foam padding around most of the pack. All of that is why I'm going to be as detailed as I can in this review, covering everything I can about a simple backpack, dotting i's and crossing t's to make sure I've given proper explanations for my opinions. This is one of the innovations that make this bag really unique. Well start with the harness system, which is one of our favoriteand most innovativepieces on this pack. First, you rotate the hip belt upwards and slide it in. More on that below. Bags can change size as you pack them out, and every airline's interpretation of compliance is different. Easy to use, great integration with Peak Design Packing Accessories, and a solid experience overall. On another trip, I packed a LaCie hard drive and its cable, a converter cable set, headphones, a second pair of headphones (because you never know), a Magic Mouse, a Rocket Blower, and my computer charger. It also works as a pass through system for roller luggage. That following helped them hit their goal for this latest bag, the Travel Series, onKickstarter in less than a day, and as of the writing of this review, it has more than six times their $500,000 goal. Then, you rotate the shoulder straps and hide them away just like you did with the hip belt. Some of these touch on points I made above, but I wanted to be clear about how these are very crucial problems. Yes, the Travel Backpack does have optional external straps but they aren't really as secure as the side pouches like on the Everyday Backpack due to the Travel Backpack's lack of a pocket on the front to secure the tripod (so it doesn't just slip out the straps). For all that, the asking price is rather steep. I am never traveling without them again, Excellent dividers in the camera cubes, as expected, Sneaky little compartments held together or closed by magnets that wonderfully hide away parts of the bag you aren't immediately using (like waist straps or the rain cover), Tons of pockets in pretty much every place you could imagine, and then more in places you didn't even consider, Even without the rain cover, the Travel Backpack is pretty water resistant thanks to sealed zippers and the choice of a non-porous exterior material, You can carry it as a duffel when moving it from one position to another. While they do rotate at their hinge, they don't actually properly adjust to fit different heights and comfort levels. I've mentioned this before when I've reviewed their other packs, but I really like how stiff and strong they are. Not new, but still useful. Empty, with no pouches or cubes, it's $235 on their Kickstarter ($300 MSRP). The top handle is nicely padded and allows you to hang the bag flush against a wall, which is always nice. They have a massive fan base and even big names like Sony and DJI are working with them to create either co-branded products or custom embroidered swag. Alla rttigheter frbehlles. The result is a bag that's just as heavy as others in its category that also makes that weight reside farther away from you as the wearer. On the sides there are some elastic loops that are actually used to fully integrate their camera cube system. Check out the full review below for all the details. Also, the way the bag is designed and how the interior works makes it kind of weird to use if it doesn't have some kind of interior to it. Okay, that was a ton on zippers.

They make them look super easy to slip on and off in their Kickstarter video, but if you try and do this with the cube full and the bag with other contents in it, it's kind of a tedious task. So, take from that what you will. Still digging the intuitiveness of this bag. I was able to fit a travel soap bottle, regular-sized toothpaste, my Sonicare, regular sized stick of deodorant, full bottle of allergy pills, another allergy medication (I have a lot of allergies), ear plugs, grooming kit, hair product, and an electric razor. There is even an exterior pocket with a small pass-through to the main compartment, so you can keep a battery in the main area and charge your phone or another device in the easier-to-reach, exterior zippered pocket. Out of the box, the cube dividers are arranged to give you eight slots for storage, one of those slots is double sized down the center. That's not a ton of stuff, but I recognize that's enough for the average photographer. But what we really love about this compartment is that the pockets are accessible from each side of the bag. Maybe in New York or similar cities where stairs and public transport make roller bags challenging, but otherwise I am doing my best to keep weight off my shoulders. This is some really nice, thoughtful innovation into an area I didn't realize needed innovating. This pocket is really secure, seeing as the zipper is virtually hidden, plus weve really never seen a pocket like thiswhich means that any potential thief probably hasnt either. Firstly, I rarely have more than one tripod, so putting it on the side of the bag automatically makes the weight poorly distributed. If this is a trip where I need to have business-appropriate attire, this is in no way happening. With that background information, it should be clear that I think of all my bags having a very specific purpose, with some minor overlap. I want them to actually do something other than just act as an unattractive belt. This backpack, on the other hand, because it's supposed to hold larger cubes in it, has just one giant compartment, which doesn't work so well for daily, everyday items. Outside of a gallon jug, were pretty confident this thing will handle any water bottle you might want to throw at it (or in it, heh). In both cases, I still had more room to work with. Firstly, it expands. This is especially handy for the camera cube insert, allowing you to quickly swap out a lens or do other #photographythings. They have managed to create a lot of usable space in a compact package. Its quite weather-resistant, and it feels nice to the touch. At this point, I would probably just pack a more complete duffel and check it rather than try and deal with this space problem with my carry-ons. Wed rather have the zippers just not break in the first placeand we really hope the zipper doesnt break on the main compartment of the Travel Backpack, as it would render the bag pretty much useless. Okay, so we have to say this hip belt is next to perfect. The cube itself, say you stripped the inside bare and removed the dividers, is just a cloth cube that can be zippered shut and features a handle for easy removal and carry-ability. However, that customer service and warranty isnt going to do you much good if your zipper breaks in a remote village in Thailand. Secondly, speaking of the material, it's perplexingly resilient and tough while also being soft, compressible, and flexible. The bag is very versatile, has a ton of pockets, and touches of the little signature things about Peak Design bags that make them so good (like magnet closures, pocket design, and swivels on the straps). The promotional videos made for this bag make it look like the duffel feature is more prominant than it actually is, though. I just don't know that rewarding them for making a bag that I honestly believe is below their capabilities as a team is good for all of us in the long term. Review: Fujinon MKX 18-55mm & 50-135mm T2.9 cinema lenses, DxO PhotoLab 2 Review: Fast & easy-to-use raw converter & editor brings out the best in your photos. It is feasible that you could get it all in the bag, but then a new problem arises: support. For real. Theyve replaced it with little to no questions asked and provided great customer service. We pride ourselves in honing every last detail of our products to perform their specific functions optimally, and working with Zoom has allowed us to do that.. You have access from the main liter compartment and from the front side as well. This is just one of those areas where you can tell that Peak Design has put a lot of thought and effort into making every square inch of this bag useful, which is incredibly important for one bag travel. I got all that to fit and still didn't use two out of the three mesh pouches on one side or the central pocket. When worn where I would like to wear them, with the amount of tension I like across the chest, the straps actually bow up and inwards a little and that breaks their ability to evenly distribute weight. On the wearers right-hand side are some additional attachment points for things like the field pouch and other accessories that Peak Design sells. So while this is a great option for summer or temperate weather destinations, it's not good if you're expecting cold. That offers a little bit more padding and locks all of your lenses and camera gear right in placeif thats your thing. The Peak Design Travel Backpack seems to have forgotten that it had vertical space to use, and instead opted for depth. You don't tend to notice it with smaller bags like the Everyday Messenger and Everyday Backpack, but when you get up in size like this one does, the actual weight of the materials used begins to show. Wrapping up the materials, there is a DWR coated polyurethane linerwhich will add some more weatherproofingaluminum hardware, and a bunch of YKK and Zoom zippers. Brilliant. There are some on the internal pockets, however, most of the zippers on the main compartment are Zoom. This last note isn't a big deal, but I had a hard time fitting my travel video tripod (the MeVideo Tripod) in this bag at all. I'm personally not sure what else can really be done to innovate on the camera "Cube" housing, but I can't say much is new with what Peak Design did here. Peak Design Travel Backpack Hideable Harness System. Peak Design is one of the most successful, fastest-growing brands in the photographic industry. But hey, we get it. Results were fairly conclusive, with 69% saying they liked the look of the pack and 31% saying they did not like the look. Depending on when youre reading this review, there might be a few new color options. I'm not getting any younger. Still going strongusing this thing is a pleasure, and no durability complaints outside of a few scratches on the aluminum hardware.

Overall, it has been a joy to useand after inspection, not much has gone wrong with the pack besides a slight scratch in the black aluminum hardware on the sternum strap.
