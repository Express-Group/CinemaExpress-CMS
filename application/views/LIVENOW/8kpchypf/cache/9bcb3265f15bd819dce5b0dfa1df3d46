Infants have the capacity to self-regulate breast-milk intake as a function of milk energy density, therefore it is difficult to predict nutrient deficiency risk solely based on human milk composition. Good practice of EBF can prevent 13.8% of all deaths among infants aged less 2 years and 11.6% of under 5-years children deaths [1012] but unfortunately a report estimated in 2012 that, only 35% of infants were exclusively breastfed globally [13]. Nutrients absorbed by the mother's gastrointestinal tract enter her bloodstream, travel to the breast lactocytes, and cross the lactocytes membranes to enter her milk. Mild to moderate maternal undernutrition can lead to suboptimal amounts of some key micronutrients in human milk (98). This finding is consistent across studies even when different human milk sampling and analysis methods are used to determine macronutrient content; and also, when socioeconomic, nutritional status, and demographic characteristicsincluding infant age at which milk samples were obtainedvary within the populations assessed. Developed by authors from evidence reported by Chaparro and Lutter (22). It is possible that within a population some women are more predisposed (genetically or otherwise) to experience insufficient milk when subjected to risk factors for a suboptimal milk volume. At the moment there is no population-level evidence indicating that exclusive breastfeeding for 6 mo compared with <6 mo increases the risk of developing food allergies. We also acknowledge Md. Some evidence shows that for some of the nutrients that can be increased in breast milk through maternal supplementation (i.e., group 1 nutrients), very high supplementation would be needed to achieve modest nutrient increases in the infant's status for the corresponding nutrient (see supplementation section below). Nutrient composition of human milk is a contributing factor to the nutritional status of the EBF infant. (70), Kent (105), Kent et al. v) Do you know honey should allow in EBF period? Ethics committee of Non-governmental Affairs Bureau (NGOAB) of Bangladesh has approved this project. In Bangladesh similar study were found in practice level on EBF [43, 44]. The enactment of individually pointer was articulated using a unit-free index between 0 and 1 in accordance with the structure technique of the Human Development Index [41]. Indeed, wide variability exists in how individual infants respond to similar amounts of maternal supplementation, and for some nutrients the amounts of maternal supplementation would need to be exceedingly high to meet infant requirements (123, 124). In the South East Asia, it was reported that prevalence of EBF were 55.0%, 66.1%, 51.4%, 70.0% for India, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka respectively [1821]. Diagnosis and Surgical Management of Neonatal Hydrocephalus. EBF-6 was reaffirmed in 2012 (3); however, concerns continue to be raised about the feasibility and safety of this recommendation, and some have called for its reexamination (4). Chowdhury  R, Sinha  B, Sankar  MJ, Taneja  S, Bhandari  N, Rollins  N, Bahl  R, Martines  J. Domellof  M, Braegger  C, Campoy  C, Colomb  V, Decsi  T, Fewtrell  M, Hojsak  I, Mihatsch  W, Molgaard  C, Shamir  R et al. SRIM may also be the result of perceptions from healthcare providers about the capacity of women to produce enough milk to satiate their infants (73, 75). Data from both trials indicated that EBF-6 infants crawled sooner and in the first trial they also walked earlier compared with EBF-4 infants (9). Does delayed perception of the onset of lactation shorten breastfeeding duration? 1Group 1 nutrients can be increased in breast milk through maternal supplementation, but group 2 nutrients cannot. Connett  GJ, Gerez  I, Cabrera-Morales  EA, Yuenyongviwat  A, Ngamphaiboon  J, Chatchatee  P, Sangsupawanich  P, Soh  SE, Yap  GC, Shek  LP et al. The WHO EBF-6 recommendation could not take human milk nutritional quality fully into account because of a lack of data on breast-milk composition in different settings. As a final point, the idea of knowledge and practices on EBF, which has some definitions; so, it is challenging to measure, particularly using the questionnaire. Author disclosures: RP-E, GSB, and SS-P, no conflicts of interest. To determine the poor newborn nourishing knowledge, practices and it doubles of the exact aims of the state plan for baby and early born children feeding [28]. Some have hypothesized that SRIM is simply a socially accepted excuse that women give for explaining why they are not practicing what they know is recommended infant-feeding behavior (71). Because that scope falls beyond the public health recommendation for EBF-6 and requires a personalized clinical approach, it is important that future reviews focus on those topics.     Writing  original draft, Affiliation Though, study highlights the need for EBF health education program educations children mothers. By contrast, maternal obesity has been consistently identified as a risk factor for DOL in low-, middle-, and high-income countries (80, 85). From the available evidence and WHO recommendations, we conclude that there is no need to change the EBF-6 recommendation based on concerns about iron-deficiency anemia. Female education should be increased substantially and hence more job opportunities could be created in various dimensional job sectors for them. Malnutrition will be decreased if EBF was widely established. Thirteen reviews and an expert report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (52, 53) found a lack of evidence to support the previous recommendations to delay introduction of potentially allergenic foods (specifically peanuts, eggs, fish, and gluten-containing foods) beyond age 12 mo to reduce the risk of allergies. According to WHO and UNICEF, EBF should start within less than one hour of delivery and must have to continue up to 6 months of infants age as it is the only source diets or fluids for babies at that age and have to sustain with balancing feeding on at the minimum 24 months of infants age [6]. Though only a few studies have been carried out in this regard, most of these studies were carried out in developed country settings [3536]. Yang  Z, Lonnerdal  B, Adu-Afarwuah  S, Brown  KH, Chaparro  CM, Cohen  RJ, Domellof  M, Hernell  O, Lartey  A, Dewey  KG. The dependent variable in this study is the level of knowledge about EBF, which was measured through nine different questions, namely: i) What do you mean by EBF? The HealthNuts cohort study in Australia reported a prevalence of food challenged-confirmed allergies of 11% at age 1 y and of 3.8% at age 4 y (42). In Bangladesh most of the rural village covered by the community clinic so, this study measured by composite index. This condition can be addressed through delayed cord clamping and medicinal iron and does not require infant food introduction before 6 mo. The questionnaire was reviewed by five specialists and assistants, and initially piloted to validate the questionnaire. Living under poverty conditions does not seem to increase the risk of DOL. Response to vitamin A supplementation varies across studies, perhaps as a function of maternal vitamin A deficiency. Evidence from high-income countries has led to an interim clinical recommendation indicating that to prevent food allergies, infants at risk of developing them should be exposed to potentially allergenic foods between the ages of 4 and 6 mo (53, 54). Out of 513 simple, 60.2% of deliveries were at hospital and 61.4% respondents were housewife. The importance of early initiation of breastfeeding as a means for reducing interference with normal lactation processes is suggested in data from 51 countries, which indicate that timing of breastfeeding initiation is a significant risk factor for early introduction of supplementary (pre-lacteal) feeds (88). The synthesis of human milk proteins, fat, and lactose involves different lactocyte organelles before secretion into the alveolar lumen (106). Expert panels suggest that adult women ingest -3 fatty acid-rich fish sources and/or supplements to consume a minimum of 3001000mg DHA/d while pregnant or breastfeeding (120122). In both studies infants were provided with safe and nutritious complementary foods (5, 6). Malnutrition will be decreased if EBF was widely established in Bangladesh. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232027.t001. In 2016, 6.5% of children in the United States suffered food allergies (40). Click through the PLOS taxonomy to find articles in your field. Recent studies suggest that maternal diet may modify the impact of early exposure to potentially allergenic foods and subsequent risk of food allergies in the breastfed infant, but this finding also requires further confirmation and better understanding of underlying biological mechanisms. The questionnaire also modified based on piloted results of the pre-test exercise to make it easier to realize and for response. The authors responsibilities were as followsRP-E and EP conceptualized the article; RP-E wrote the first draft; all authors critically reviewed several manuscript versions, read and approved the final manuscript.

Conceptualization, In 2012, the WHO commissioned an updated systematic review of the evidence on EBF duration. The prevalence of knowledge and practices on EBF were 34.5% and 27.9% among mothers having at least one child aged 612 months. Peters  RL, Koplin  JJ, Gurrin  LC, Dharmage  SC, Wake  M, Ponsonby  AL, Tang  MLK, Lowe  AJ, Matheson  M, Dwyer  T et al. This study suggested that education and EBF related intervention could play an important role to increase good knowledge and practices on EBF among mothers.

Iannotti  LL, Lutter  CK, Stewart  CP, GallegosRiofrio  CA, Malo  C, Reinhart  G, Palacios  A, Karp  C, Chapnick  M, Cox  K et al. Socio-economic and demographic differences regarding knowledge and practices of EBF were assessed by 2 test through significance for all analyses was set at p<0.05. The individually appropriate reply was given 1 point, while improper replies received 0 point [40]. The authors gratefully acknowledge the authority of CCs of Rajshahi District, Bangladesh for giving permission to take data from CCs catchment area. Table 2 showed the socio-economic and demographic factors about practices on EBF related appearances of the respondents. This study was found poor knowledge and practices on EBF. Children mothers age 21 years (adjusted odds ratio, (AOR) = 13.840; 95% confidence interval CI: 7.39425.904), mothers were more likely to have a good knowledge on EBF compared to their counterparts and it was statistically significant (p<0.05).

Descriptive analyses were conducted to ascertain the socio-economic and demographic factors by knowledge and practices of EBF of the subjects. This protective effect may be the result of training the immune system to recognize these foods during a sensitive time in development of the infant's immune system (52). It is important to reiterate that whereas some of the micronutrients in milk are affected by maternal diet (most of the vitamins, plus iodine and selenium), others are not (most of the minerals, including iron and zinc). . . In summary, providing small tastes of potentially allergenic foods under medical supervision to 4 to 6 mo old infants at high risk of developing food allergies (such as infants with a family history of allergies to eggs and peanuts) has been endorsed by several professional allergy societies in high-income countries for the purpose of preventing future food allergies (5254, 67). This study suggested for more longitudinal research to realize this complex relationship and understand the fundamental tools. The finding that infant demand drives breast-milk production and subsequent consumption has been reported in multiple studies in high-income countries (133, 134).     Conceptualization, Second, mothers have knowledge and practice about EBF who were aged  20 years, Housewife, hospital delivery, joint family members and  9,999 BDT monthly family income mothers were more likely to have knowledge and practices on EBF. Iron-deficiency anemia during early infancy has been identified as a risk associated with EBF-6, with potential long-term motor and mental developmental consequences (20). Parents, other caregivers, and health providers should be taught how to identify the developmental cues that signal readiness for complementary feeding. This study observed that Joint family members mothers in our study share their findings with other family members but not properly follow various types of religious orthodoxy. PLOS ONE promises fair, rigorous peer review, Before sampling, 612 month children lists were got from the Paba upazila Health Complex, Rajshahi that list used for expanded programme on immunization. The United Kingdom's Learning Early About A Peanut Allergy trial found that exposing infants from age 4 to 11 mo, who were at high risk of peanut allergy, to small tastes of peanut butter reduced the risk of developing allergies to these foods later in life (55). . Lactocytes or milk-producing cells lining the inner walls of the mammary gland alveoli become activated for milk synthesis in response to infant suckling (104). Recommendations on the introduction of potentially allergenic foods in high-income countries remains controversial. On average, women need an additional 500kcal/d to support lactation, compared to 250kcal/d during the second trimester of pregnancy and 452kcal/d during the third trimester (103). This study found poor knowledge and practices on EBF among mothers. In this study, data were collected from September to December2015 (i) socio-demographic characteristics and (ii) knowledge about EBF using a semi-structured questionnaire. Place of delivery was divided into two group hospital and home and occupation also classified into two categorized such as housewife and service holder. Consistent with these findings, Chapman and Prez-Escamilla (80) found in a sample of American women that unscheduled cesarean delivery or vaginal delivery with a prolonged second stage (the pushing stage) of labor were risk factors for DOL.

Micronutrient research, programs, and policy: From meta-analyses to metabolomics, B vitamins in breast milk: relative importance of maternal status and intake, and effects on infant status and function, Iron deficiency in young children in low-income countries and new approaches for its prevention, Iron supplementation affects growth and morbidity of breast-fed infants: results of a randomized trial in Sweden and Honduras, Iron intake and iron status in breastfed infants during the first year of life, Full breastfeeding duration and risk for iron deficiency in U.S. infants. All but 2 of these studies were observational. This is in large part because there are still many uncertainties about infant nutrient requirements during the first 6 mo of life and hence there is a lack of blood thresholds for identifying micronutrient deficiencies (99, 100, 103). However, others have postulated that SRIM may result from not understanding the lactation process, as women often report SRIM within the first 2 d after birth, a time when only small amounts of colostrum are being produced, and they introduce breast-milk substitutes in response to this (i.e., pre-lacteal feeding) (7274). Persistent reports of insufficient milk by women globally are likely to be the result of lack of access to timely lactation counseling and social support rather than primary biological reasons. fucosyltransferase-2 secretor status); and is a strong determinant of the microbiome. viii) Do you know what is happen if EBF were not done? From the total sample population, approximately 61.2% and 79.5% were  20 years of age and Muslim. In the exceptional circumstances where formula supplementation may be called for, it should be done with careful oversight from a qualified provider, keeping in mind that early breastfeeding problems and corresponding introduction of infant formula are major risk factors for the early termination of both exclusive breastfeeding and any breastfeeding (74, 91, 156160). Before going to data collection this study were shortly discussed with the participants about its objectives. This study was assumption that educated mothers have and practices. EAT found that the exposed infants were less likely to develop food allergies compared with their counterparts who continued EBF for about 6 mo (59). In the Gambia study, both maternal and infant thiamine status improved in <2 wk after supplementation. A picture of rural area housewife respondents watched Bangladesh television. However, this study measures the knowledge and practices through a lot of indicators which were reflected by several previous studies [26,5255]. The knowledge score is poor = 04 and good = 59 and the practice level score is poor = 0 <1, good = 1 [42]. In Paba, 530 mothers were selected out of 5,123, mothers who having at least one child age 612 months and finally 513 samples were successfully interviewed [39]. However, more recent expert reviews do not support this recommendation (60). The WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding of infants for the first 6 mo of life (EBF-6).

From the total sample population, 61.2% and 78.9% were  20 years of age and Muslim group respectively. Furthermore, it was found that these characteristics were statistically significant (p<0.05). Sinha  B, Chowdhury  R, Sankar  MJ, Martines  J, Taneja  S, Mazumder  S, Rollins  N, Bahl  R, Bhandari  N. Perez-Escamilla  R, Segura-Millan  S, Pollitt  E, Dewey  KG.         here. Based on the results from RCTs and observational studies included in this review, it was concluded that: 1) no significant differences were found in growth among EBF-6 children compared with those with other EBF durations; 2) a lower incidence of gastrointestinal infection among EBF-6 infants was found when compared to infants receiving EBF for shorter durations; and 3) there was a potential risk for development of iron-deficiency anemia before age 6 mo, especially among exclusively breastfed infants born with suboptimal iron reserves and among LBW infants (1). The WHO committee issuing the EBF-6 recommendation in 2001 acknowledged the dearth of evidence they had available to assess how EBF impacts maternal nutrition. Hence, currently we do not see a basis for changing the EBF-6 public health recommendation based on concerns about suboptimal maternal dietary intakes. I. Those mothers monthly family income 10,000 Bangladeshi taka (BDT) currency was (AOR = 0.092, 95% CI: 0.0500.168, p<0.05) times less likely to have practices of EBF compared to their counterparts. CCs based activities implemented by Development Association for Self-reliance Communication and Health (DASCOH Foundation) and financially supported by Swiss Red Cross (SRC). A total of 513 individuals were involved in this stud. Hence, a change to the EBF-6 recommendation for the population at large to prevent food allergies is unwarranted. We found no evidence to support changes to the EBF-6 public health recommendation, although variability in inter-infant developmental readiness is recognized. Understanding the physiology of lactation sheds light on some of these outstanding questions. These 2 studies showed that human milk responds to maternal riboflavin supplementation, and that riboflavin status rapidly improved in both mothers and infants after maternal supplementation was started. It was found that the model chi-square was 388.475 (p value = 0.001) and Nagelkerke R2 of the fitted model was 0.765 which also express the good fit of the model. Recent studies suggest that breastfeeding may protect against development of food allergies and that this relation may be influenced by maternal diet. Nommsen et al. The delayed cord clamping recommendation was issued by WHO based on strong evidence, and was subsequently incorporated into the WHO's Essential Newborn Care Course in 2012 (36) and to an official WHO Guideline in 2014 (37). Indeed, infant vitamin and mineral supplementation is permitted within the WHO definition of EBF. HMO composition varies between maternal-infant dyads, and may be influenced by maternal diet and other environmental exposures, as well as lactation stage, degree of breastfeeding exclusivity, and genetics (e.g. In instances where formula supplementation is required, it should be done under the guidance of a qualified provider taking into account that early introduction of breast-milk supplements is a risk factor for early termination of exclusive breastfeeding and any breastfeeding. With regard to group 2 nutrients, studies in a rural Mexican Otomi population confirmed that maternal folate status is unrelated to folate concentration in human milk, and that folate concentration in breast milk cannot be altered through maternal supplementation (128). A population-based parent survey conducted in the United States at around the same time reported a slightly higher prevalence of food allergies among children aged <18 y (7.6%), with peanut allergy being the most commonly reported (41). ii) What type of feed you allow during your EBF period for your last baby? (2020) Knowledge and practices of exclusive breastfeeding among mothers in rural areas of Rajshahi district in Bangladesh: A community clinic based study. This study surveyed the knowledge and practices on EBF among mothers at rural area of the CCs in Rajshahi district, Bangladesh. Group 1 and Group 2 nutrients in human milk1. The risk for iron deficiency in the first 6 mo of life can be successfully mitigated by delayed umbilical-cord clamping (22, 33, 34) (Figure 1). From the analyses, mothers age of 21 years were (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 13.840, 95% CI: 7.39425.904; p<0.001) times more likely to have knowledge on EBF and (AOR = 0.084, 95% CI: 0.0500.143; p<0.05) times less likely to have practices of EBF compared to mothers age 20 years. PLoS ONE 15(5): A community clinic based study was conducted in the rural area of Rajshahi district, Bangladesh. Similar to the findings from the Honduran studies, an RCT conducted in Iceland found no infant growth advantage for EBF-4 compared with EBF-6 infants. Because RCTs are the gold standard for making causal inferences, the scarcity of RCTs underlying the WHO EBF-6 recommendation is seen by some as a weakness. Likewise, prenatal insulin profiles denoting poor blood glucose control have been associated with DOL in the United States (87). For example, in a study conducted in the United States among exclusively breastfed infants whose mothers increased their milk supply by expressing additional breast milk for 2 wk, breast-milk intake was driven by infant demand and not by increased maternal breast -ilk production capacity (134). A study conducted in the United Kingdom (136) that allowed for mothers to randomly select the breast from which to feed the baby first, found that intake from the second breast was only about 60% of the amount consumed from the first breast. Children especially new born babies are at large danger of malnutrition from first six months of life when breast milk alone is necessary to meet all nutritious supplies and balancing feeding needs to be in progress [8, 9].

Fewtrell  M, Bronsky  J, Campoy  C, Domellof  M, Embleton  N, FidlerMis  N, Hojsak  I, Hulst  JM, Indrio  F, Lapillonne  A et al. However, the numerous maternal and child health benefits associated with breastfeeding (1319) make experimental research designs impractical and unlikely to receive ethical approval in many settings.

Before measuring the level of knowledge and practices using consistent or reliability of respondents answer. Several studies have been performed to assess the knowledge, perception and practices on breastfeeding among females and shown global trends in EBF [13, 28], knowledge, attitude and techniques of breastfeeding under five children mothers in Nigerian [29,30], knowledge and practices of EBF in Nigerian populations [28]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232027.s001.

Original model prepared by authors from evidence reported by Dewey et al. Fewtrell  M, Wilson  DC, Booth  I, Lucas  A. Cohen  RJ, Brown  KH, Canahuati  J, Rivera  LL, Dewey  KG. Concentrations of vitamin D in human milk correlate with maternal vitamin D intake and sunlight exposure. EBF, by its various recognized health welfare for babies, children, and their mothers, was a crucial plan to recover public health [14]. As the evidence presented below indicates, lack of timely lactation management and social support appear to be the strongest predictors of SRIM and other lactation difficulties (70, 72, 7981) (Figure 2). iii) Do you know when supplementary feeding is needed? Another study conducted by the same research group in the same population found that residual breast-milk volume, defined as total volume extracted minus mean milk intake in a 24-h period to predict milk volume left in the breast when the infant had completed nursing, was around 100g/d, and this applied to infants consuming relatively low amounts of breast milk (<650g/d) (135). The reported prevalence of food allergies varies considerably among countries.     Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Northern University, Dhaka, Bangladesh, Affiliation Diagnosis and Management of Seizures in the Preterm Infant. Further research is needed to continue developing standards for human milk production, consumption, and composition in diverse settings and at different stages of lactation (77, 99). Therefore, in the following sections we examine drivers of milk synthesis and nutrient transport. In contrast, early cord clamping in the same infant would provide sufficient iron for 3 mo only (34). 3Fore milk refers to breast milk sampled at beginning of the nursing episode; hind milk refers to milk sampled toward the end of the nursing episode. LBW infants also benefit from delayed cord clamping. Regression analysis of the factors associated with the knowledge and among mothers on EBF. An extra assumption was that most of the house wife mother, secondary and higher level of educated mothers knew EBF benefit so their practices level is high as paralleled with the housewife respondents. . We found that housewife respondents have practices as matched to their counterpart.
